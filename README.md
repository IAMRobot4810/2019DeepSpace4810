# I.AM.ROBOT, Team 4810, LabVIEW code for the 2019 FIRST Robotics Competition: Deep Space

# How to commit to the code properly:
- The "Projects" tab has several projects based on different subjects, such as Auton or Teleop
- In each Project, there are various task "Cards" that describe changes that should be made
- At some point, (maybe imediatly idk) convert the "card" to an "Issue" using the three vertical dots
  - This allows you to assign people to it, and track changes on a comments thread
- When you have an issue that you think you fixed and want to test, commit your code. Please say what you did and what you still need to do (if applicable). @mention anyone who worked with you on it. 
- After you commit, go to the "Code" tab, and then the "Commits" sub-tab. Find the commit that you just made, and copy its link using the button that looks like a clipboard
- Go to the relevant Comments thread for your issue, and paste link to your commit. A short description of what you did to solve the issue is fine, anyone can follow the link to your original description found in the commit. 
- Following any tests that you make, mention how they go in the comments thread

- As the issue progresses, move the Issue Card along the Columns. Eventually you can close the Issue, meaning it is not worked on anymore (unless we re-open it :-p)

# More Procedure
- At compititions
  - Untill we figure out a better way, make a copy of the code and put it in its own sub-file. It's a backup.
  - Before you change anything, get the most qualified and availible mentor to approve it. 
- In General
  - Anything that goes on the robot goes through the Golden Laptop. Put a copy of it on a "Backups" file on the desktop so the next person who uses it knows what code is on the robot. Its annoying. I know. Live with it.
  - If you are going to try something risky make a new branch. Describe it, and delete it when you're done
